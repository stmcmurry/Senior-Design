Repository for senior design project. 
This is the control system for the Youcan submarine that is controlled with an Android phone and two programs that handle mouse and keyboard inputs.
The two files needed are in the Submarine Control file called controlSystem.py and subMovement.py.
The .zip file in the main directory will also need to be downloaded in order to connect to the Android phone.
For a full screen sontrol system, the files can be found in the Submarine Control Full Screen folder.
